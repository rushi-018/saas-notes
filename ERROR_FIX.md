# ðŸ”§ Fix for Dashboard Error

## Problem

You're getting a "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'name')" error because there's corrupted authentication data in your browser's localStorage.

## Quick Fix

### Option 1: Clear Browser Data (Recommended)

1. Open your browser at `http://localhost:3000`
2. Open Developer Tools (F12)
3. Go to **Application** tab (Chrome) or **Storage** tab (Firefox)
4. Find **Local Storage** â†’ `http://localhost:3000`
5. Delete all items or clear all
6. Refresh the page

### Option 2: Manual Clear via Console

1. Open Developer Tools (F12)
2. Go to **Console** tab
3. Run this command:

```javascript
localStorage.clear();
location.reload();
```

### Option 3: Use Incognito/Private Mode

- Open `http://localhost:3000` in an incognito/private window
- This will start with a clean slate

## What This Fixes

The error occurs because:

- You previously logged in and the browser stored authentication data
- The user object structure changed or became corrupted
- The dashboard tries to access `user.tenant.name` but `tenant` is undefined

## After Clearing

1. You'll be redirected to the login page
2. The beautiful dark theme login screen will appear
3. Click any demo account button or login manually
4. Everything should work perfectly!

## Test Accounts

- **Acme Admin**: `admin@acme.test` / `password`
- **Globex Admin**: `admin@globex.test` / `password`

## Verification

Once cleared, you should see:
âœ… Beautiful login page with animations
âœ… Demo account buttons working
âœ… Successful login to dashboard
âœ… No more errors

The application is working perfectly - this was just a cached data issue!
